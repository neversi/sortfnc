# sortfnc
sortfnc is a sorting algorithm package written in go.
The list of algorithms:
```bash
BubbleSort
InsertionSort
MergeSort
QuickSort
SelectionSort
ShakerSort
```

## How to use
Before building main package it is required (as far as I know) to create module 
```bash
go mod init mod
```
And after test it with
```bash
go test
```
command. Or 
```bash
go build <main file>
```

## End
